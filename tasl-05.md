# 📈 Excel Task: Currency Conversion Table

## 🔧 Task Description

This Excel task will help you practice using **absolute** and **relative** cell references by building a currency conversion table.

You are given a list of product prices in **Indian Rupees (INR)**. Your task is to convert each price to **US Dollars (USD)** using a fixed exchange rate.

## 📁 Given Data

| Product Name | Price (INR) | USD Rate | Price (USD) |
|--------------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Laptop       | 60000       |          |             |
| Headphones   | 2500        |          |             |
| Keyboard     | 1500        |          |             |
| Smartphone   | 30000       |          |             |

✅ Use a fixed **USD exchange rate** of `0.012`, and enter it in **cell C1**.

---

## 📌 Task Instructions

1. Enter the USD exchange rate `0.012` in **cell C1**.
2. In **cell D2**, write a formula to convert the price from INR to USD.
3. Use a mix of **relative** and **absolute** cell references.
4. Drag the formula from **D2 to D5** to convert the prices of all products.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Practice applying **absolute references** to fixed values (like rates).
- Use **relative references** for changing row values.
- Build efficient, scalable formulas by combining both reference types.

> 💬 Challenge: Change the exchange rate to `0.013` and see how the converted prices update automatically.
