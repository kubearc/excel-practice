## ✅ Solution Steps

1. **Total Cost** = `Unit Price × Quantity`  
   Formula in **E2**:  
   ```excel
   =B2*C2
````

2. **Discount Amount** = `Total Cost × (Discount ÷ 100)`
   Formula in **F2**:

   ```excel
   =E2*(D2/100)
   ```

3. **Final Price** = `Total Cost − Discount Amount`
   Formula in **G2**:

   ```excel
   =E2-F2
   ```

📌 **Drag the formulas** from row 2 down to fill rows 3 to 5.
